This is a bunch of notes and patches on converting the CSRG SCCS
to a git repo for ease of browsing.

- Obtain CSRG Archive CD set from http://www.mckusick.com/csrg/
- Install VCS-SCCS from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/dist/VCS-SCCS/)
- apply SCCS-fix.patch to SCCS tree copied off CD 4
- run sccs2git-r-noignore from the top level of the sccs tree

sccs2git-r-noignore is one of the examples from VCS-SCCS-0.20
- modified so the timestamps match the sccs logs
- modified to not create a .gitignore
- modified to have a default domain of ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU
it has the same license as the rest of VCS-SCCS:
